Overview
--------

A website for an imaginary cookie company. Includes a public-facing page describing the product and sales locations, a sales page with a web-based interface for modeling cookie sales, and stylish style guide. The public-facing page includes animation, while the sales page allows the user to add or edit shops to the sales projections table. The whole projections is designed to provide a stylistic foundation (rock solid, of course) for the salmon cookie brand.
